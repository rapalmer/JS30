    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 42 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
